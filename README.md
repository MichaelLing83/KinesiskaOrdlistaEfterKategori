För lektion på Memrise (http://www.memrise.com/course/749344/kinesiska-ordlista-efter-kategori/).

## File names
All files are named as <3-digit-number>_<title>.txt, one for each level in the course. For files whose level is not decided, xxx is used for the <3-digit-number> part. And there is a "xxx_unsorted.txt" to hold all word entries that have not been moved to a level.

## File formats
* each line is one word entry
* each word entry has 5 columns: mandarin, swedish, pinyin, anteckningar, ordklass
* columns are seperated with one tab

## Pinyin
[This great site](https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-pinyin-chart.php) with audio can be really useful.

All pinyin are marked with tone (1 to 4), if it is ommitted, then it is an unstressed syllable. Also the tones are marked as how they would be pronounced colloquial. So tone changes are taken into consideration. E.g. yi1 will change to yi4 before a syllable with the third tone: yi4bai3.
